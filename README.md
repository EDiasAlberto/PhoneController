## Requirements

#### Hardware
- ESP32
- Computer
- Phone
- Cable connection between ESP32 and Computer

#### Software
- Python
- Arduino IDE
- Web browser on phone

## Setup

- Flash and upload the arduino code to ESP32
- Run Python server on computer
- Connect ESP32 to PC
- Open Serial monitor to get IP Address
- Use phone to connect to IP Address of ESP32

## Notes

- The ESP32 is unnecessary and the webserver logic could be hosted on the PC
- However, there are plans for using other sensors of the ESP32 for more inputs
- Also, inputting directly to the ESP32 is a potential avenue to explore
